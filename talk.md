# Introduction and Overview

.huge[
- This work is really all thanks to BNL team
      - Doug Benjamin
      - Ofer Rind
      - Chris Hollowell
- Ongoing process, but today just showing the first (unoptimized) steps that came together pleasantly quickly
- Today showing examples of running at BNL's SDCC Jupyter instance

# BNL SDCC Jupyter Launcher: custom images!

# Development image: analysis-systems-base

.kol-1-2.huge[
- As we can use custom images at BNL created the `analysis-systems-base` image (https://github.com/iris-hep/analysis-systems-base)
- Images are hosted on [OSG Harbor](https://hub.opensciencegrid.org/harbor/projects/863/repositories/analysis-systems-base) under `iris-hep` org
   - `hub.opensciencegrid.org/iris-hep/analysis-systems-base`
   - Thanks Brian Lin for making this happen!

# Development image: analysis-systems-base

.kol-1-2.huge[
- As we can use custom images at BNL created the `analysis-systems-base` image (https://github.com/iris-hep/analysis-systems-base)
- Goal is to use lock files to make as much of the image as fully reproducible as possible and statically defined.

.huge[
- Doug has moved data to `/usatlas/atlas01/atlasdisk/users/benjamin/AGC/`
- Notebook runs end-to-end (good first start ðŸš€)
- BNL does not use Kubernetes, so not a Coffea-casa AF, so use global config
```python
...
PIPELINE = "coffea"  # pure coffea setup
USE_DASK = True  # enable Dask
AF = "local"  # local setup, not coffea-casa
AF_NAME = "bnl"  # Added on Matthew's fork
...
```

.huge[
- Execute the data delivery pipeline step
- Nothing that I've done at BNL has been optimized yet (just doing defaults)
- .bold[N.B.] Need to get better information on how scaling is done at BNL (so comparisons are not valid here yet)
   - UChicago AF is running with `AF = "coffea_casa"` and so scaling across k8

# Summary

.huge[
- Have a runnable environment for AGC at BNL AF (ðŸš€)
- BNL team is working to make drop-in with custom images well specified and easy
- Things work, but to understand how scaling is working will need to improve the monitoring story
   - Currently don't have Dask dashboards detecting the Dask cluster
- Also need to try other AGC analyses and expand / modify environment
